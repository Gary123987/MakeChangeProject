## Lessons Learned
1. Values can be changed multiple times throughout a program. This can be used to keep subtracting fixed amounts that are progressively smaller. In this project, the most straightforward way was to have one value for the total change, then remove the multiples of 20, then 10, and so on. only one variable was needed to do this. 

2. If loops can be stacked on each other indefinitely. If you have a single piece of data that you want to analyze and manipulate over and over, you can establish the value of this variable, and use a series of if loops to keep changing the value, while returning information each time. 

3. sysout is useful for finding where bugs exist in you program. by putting sysouts at each step throughout the program, you can see what is happening at each step throughout. This helps you visualize whats happening inside your code, and lets you pinpoint any issues that may occur.
